1. '-e .'
--> In the context of Python and modular coding, the -e . is used when installing a package in "editable" mode. 
This is often done during development to allow changes to the code in the package to take effect immediately without reinstalling the package each time.

2. setup.py
--> this file contains several libraries and initial setup for package installations
--> this is the initial process to do in modular programmming
 a. __init__.py 
 --> this must be created whenever we create any folder to initialize that folder

3. src/ components
--> this file contains python files namely modules we specifically going to used in the projects

4. src/ components/ data_ingestion.py
--> this file used to loading dataset from locally or from various sources
--> here also use train test split, validations etc..

5. src/ components/ data_transformation.py
--> this file is used for feature engineering like encoding, converting words into numerical classes

6. src/ components/ model_trainer.py
---> model trraining

7.src/components/ pipeline
--> this folder contain 2 file means, training pipeline and predict pipeline
--> train pipeline used to trigger all the files in the components folder

8 src / components/loggers.py
--> in this folder create logger.py - Logging is crucial for capturing information about the execution of your code, debugging, and monitoring. 

10. @dataclass inside data_ingestion.py
--> this decorator helpful for defining class without defining methods like __init__
--> this is importing from dataclass
--> if we are defining only variable, then we can define @dataclass, when we use other methods, go without @dataclass
